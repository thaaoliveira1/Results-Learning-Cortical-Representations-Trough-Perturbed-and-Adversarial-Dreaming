    "1. **`calculate_frechet_distance`** is a function that calculates the Frechet distance between two multivariate Gaussian distributions. It takes four parameters: **`mu1`**, **`sigma1`**, **`mu2`**, and **`sigma2`**, which represent the mean and covariance matrices of the two distributions. The optional parameter **`eps`** is used for numerical stability. The function implements the formula for the Frechet distance: **`d^2 = ||mu1 - mu2||^2 + Tr(C1 + C2 - 2*sqrt(C1*C2))`**, where **`mu1`** and **`mu2`** are the means, **`C1`** and **`C2`** are the covariance matrices, and **`Tr`** denotes the trace operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The function first ensures that **`mu1`** and **`mu2`** are at least 1-dimensional arrays, and **`sigma1`** and **`sigma2`** are at least 2-dimensional arrays using the **`np.atleast_1d`** and **`np.atleast_2d`** functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. It then checks if **`mu1`** and **`mu2`** have the same shape, and if **`sigma1`** and **`sigma2`** have the same shape. If the shapes are not equal, it raises assertions to indicate that the mean vectors and covariance matrices have different lengths or dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The function calculates the difference between **`mu1`** and **`mu2`** and stores it in the variable **`diff`**.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Next, it computes the square root of the matrix product of **`sigma1`** and **`sigma2`** using the **`sqrtm`** function from **`scipy.linalg`**. This operation is stored in the variable **`covmean`**.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. The function checks if **`covmean`** contains any non-finite (e.g., NaN or infinity) values. If it does, it adds a small epsilon value to the diagonal of **`sigma1`** and **`sigma2`** to ensure numerical stability. This step helps handle cases where the covariance matrices are ill-conditioned or singular.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. If the **`covmean`** matrix is complex, the function checks if the imaginary components on the diagonal are close to zero within a tolerance. If not, it raises a **`ValueError`** indicating the presence of a significant imaginary component.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Finally, the function calculates the trace of **`covmean`** and returns the Frechet distance as the sum of the squared difference between the means and the trace of the covariance matrices.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. The **`calculate_frechet`** function takes two inputs: **`inception_real`** and **`inception_fake`**, which represent the real and fake samples, respectively, and calculates the Frechet Inception Distance (FID) between them. It also takes a **`model`** parameter, which is not used in the provided code snippet.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. Inside **`calculate_frechet`**, the mean (**`mu_1`** and **`mu_2`**) and covariance (**`std_1`** and **`std_2`**) of the real and fake samples are calculated using the **`np.mean`** and **`np.cov`** functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. The FID value is obtained by calling the **`calculate_frechet_distance`** function with the calculated mean and covariance values.\n",
    "\n",
    "12. Finally, the FID value is returned as the result of the **`calculate_frechet`** function.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the code provides a way to calculate the Frechet Inception Distance, which is a measure of similarity between two sets of samples based on their mean vectors and covariance matrices. The **`calculate_frechet_distance`** function implements the mathematical formula for the Frechet distance, while the **`calculate_frechet`** function orchestrates the calculation by extracting the mean and covariance values from the input samples and calling the `calculate_frechet_distance"
